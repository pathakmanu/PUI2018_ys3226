# This is a markdown file written by Yavuz Sunor describing PUI2018 Homework4 step by step for each assignment. 

## Assignment 1 
Plotted means of 100 different sample(each with different number of elements) for five different distributions(chisquare, normal, poisson, binomial and lognormal)
And finally putted all distributions into one histogram plot which provides also a visusal comparison.

## Assignment 2
Get the citibike data for 201807 in NYC. Put it into the PUIDATA environmental variable and read from there using pandas. 
Came up with an IDEA and Null Hypothesis which requires to make an analysis with two variables; hours of each days throughout the month and usertype(customer, subscriber), respectively.
At the end, calculated two different percentage for each usertype for each hours of the day to test the Null Hypothesis.

## Assignment 3
Tested the idea of the efficiency of proposed new bus line. Created and formulated a Null Hypothesis. 
Calculated the mean and standard deviation of a new sample consists of 100 observation. 
Based on old information about average time of commute and its standard deviation came up with a z-score which helps us to evalutate Null Hypothesis.
